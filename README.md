# JR-27-INVICTUS

Name of app/solution: Invictus23_RuralComm

Chosen Problem Statement:

JR-PS-02-CommunityPlatform - To create a community platform for rural people and a pool of professionals, to share their problems and solutions.

Approach:

We have developed a website for rural people which will serve as an all-inclusive platform for them. Generally in rural areas, people do not have access to such platforms where they can showcase their talent and earn a livelihood in return. Our website offers them a place to share their talents - services/materialistic items and sell those to the people from their community as well as the outside world. Getting funds for a business idea will become easier through our platform when the users share it and investors/other people see and invest. We have also provided a forum for the people to discuss their issues and get solutions for the same. The courses tab on our website will make it easier for the rural community to join training sessions that can help them in skill development. The dashboard displays upcoming events which can help these people stay connected, learn skills from each other and sell their products.

Features:

Registration/ Login for Members of the Community

Login for Outsiders

Home Page for Members - shows announcements of upcoming events, development projects, etc

Discussion Forum - Members can discuss their issues and get solutions from the community

Courses - List of upcoming trainings by Government/NGOs for upskilling the community members

Market-Place - Platform/page to upload details about any article created by member/service provided by them that they want to sell within/outside the community

Survey - Survey form for feedback related to any development projects

Conclusion:

We understood the need of a community platform for rural areas. We learnt the technology behind web application development using Angular, use of Springboot framework for implementing REST APIs and connecting to PostgreSQL DB. Also, while implementing our solution, we came across different technical problems and found a way out of those. This will help us in the future when we try to solve more real-world problems as IT professionals.
