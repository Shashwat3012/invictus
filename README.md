# RURAL COMM


## Introduction
Name of app/solution: Invictus23_RuralComm
Chosen Problem Statement:
JR-PS-02-CommunityPlatform - To create a community platform for rural people and a pool of professionals, to share their problems and solutions.
Approach:

We have developed a website for rural people which will serve as an all-inclusive platform for them. Generally in rural areas, people do not have access to such platforms where they can showcase their talent and earn a livelihood in return. Our website offers them a place to share their talents - services/materialistic items and sell those to the people from their community as well as the outside world. Getting funds for a business idea will become easier through our platform when the users share it and investors/other people see and invest. We have also provided a forum for the people to discuss their issues and get solutions for the same. The courses tab on our website will make it easier for the rural community to join training sessions that can help them in skill development. The dashboard displays upcoming events which can help these people stay connected, learn skills from each other and sell their products.

## Features:

1. Registration/ Login for Members of the Community
2. Login for Outsiders
3. Home Page for Members - shows announcements of upcoming events, development projects, etc
4. Discussion Forum - Members can discuss their issues and get solutions from the community
5. Courses - List of upcoming trainings by Government/NGOs for upskilling the community members
6. Market-Place - Platform/page to upload details about any article created by member/service provided by them that they want to sell within/outside the community
7. Ideas-Wall - Place where members can share their ideas with the community/outside world and get fundings/resources for the same
8. Community Information - Page where all members of the community are shown
9. Survey - Survey form for feedback related to any development projects
10. My Profile Page - Info about logged in member
11. Logout

## Documentation

[Angular](https://angular.io/guide/setup-local) \
[SpringBoot](https://spring.io/quickstart) \
[Spring Java Mail](https://www.javatpoint.com/spring-java-mail-tutorial)

## Installation

Install this project locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shashwat3012/UtkarshForm.git
cd UtkarshForm
```

Frontend Setup: \
change into frontend directory using

```bash
cd frontend/
```

install the dependencies using

```bash
npm install
```

\
After the installation is complete, run the following command to start the frontend on `localhost:4200`.

```bash
ng serve
```

\
Backend Setup: \
Open up the project in your IDE and locate the `UtkarshFormApplication.java` file in the `src/main/java/com/shashwat/utkarshForm` folder.

Let’s build and run the program. Open a command line (or terminal) and navigate to the folder where you have the project files. We can build and run the application by issuing the following command:

```bash
.\gradlew.bat bootRun
```

or

Simply locate the `UtkarshFormApplication.java` file and run it in your IDE.

The Spring gets started on running the above command. Spring Boot’s embedded Apache Tomcat server is acting as a webserver and is listening for requests on `localhost port 8080`.

\
Once both Frontend and Backend servers are up and running, the application performs all the functionalities shown in the video.

## Conclusion:

We understood the need of a community platform for rural areas. We learnt the technology behind web application development using Angular, use of Springboot framework for implementing REST APIs and connecting to PostgreSQL DB. Also, while implementing our solution, we came across different technical problems and found a way out of those. This will help us in the future when we try to solve more real-world problems as IT professionals.
